I’m Sridevi Velpula, a passionate DevOps Engineer and curious explorer of technology. I believe that learning never stops, and I enjoy exploring new tools, solving challenges, and sharing the insights I gain throughout my journey.

On this blog, I share my hands-on experiences by breaking down complex DevOps concepts into simple, practical tutorials you can apply. You’ll also find interview questions I’ve encountered, career advice I wish I had earlier, and personal reflections from my journey in tech.

This space is more than just technical content—it’s designed to help others grow by providing valuable resources and guidance for every step of their learning journey.
