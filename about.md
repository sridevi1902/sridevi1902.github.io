# About Me

Hi, I'm **Sridevi Velpula**, a passionate DevOps Engineer and curious explorer of technology. I believe that learning never stops, and I enjoy discovering new tools, tackling challenges, and sharing the insights I gather along the way.

I specialize in tools like AWS, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Terraform, Jenkins, and more. On this blog, I document practical DevOps tutorials, real-world lessons, interview questions, and reflections from my journey in tech.

This space is built to help others grow, providing the guidance I once searched for â€” now shared with you.
