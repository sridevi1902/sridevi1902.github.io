**Hi, I'm Sridevi Velpula**, — a passionate DevOps Engineer and curious explorer of technology. I believe learning never stops, and I enjoy discovering new tools, tackling challenges, and sharing the insights I gather along the way.

**On this blog you’ll find:**

I share my hands-on experiences by breaking down complex DevOps concepts into simple, practical tutorials you can easily apply. You’ll also find interview questions I’ve encountered, career advice I wish I had earlier, and personal reflections from my journey in tech.

This space is more than just technical content — it’s created to help others grow by providing valuable resources and guidance at every step of their learning journey.
